				  <p> Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Torontoâ€™s stylish Yorkville locale, development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.<br><br>

In contrast to other Indian eateries, we made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.<br><br>

We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.<br><br>

Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forget the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.</p>
